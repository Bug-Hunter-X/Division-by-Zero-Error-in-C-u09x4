# Division by Zero Bug in C
This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.

The original code attempts to divide an integer by zero, resulting in undefined behavior.  This can lead to program crashes or unpredictable outputs. The solution demonstrates how to handle potential division by zero using checks to prevent such errors.
